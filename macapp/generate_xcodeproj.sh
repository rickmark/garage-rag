# SKIP_EMBEDDED_FRAMEWORKS_VALIDATION: rules_apple's macos_framework produces a
# shallow bundle (PythonXPCService.framework has Info.plist at its root), which is
# what `aspect build //:macapp` ships. Xcode's Validate step on the app rejects that
# layout ("expected Versions/Current/Resources/Info.plist since the platform does not
# use shallow bundles"), so without this the Garage scheme cannot build in Xcode.
#
# DONT_RUN_SWIFT_STDLIB_TOOL: Xcode's CopySwiftLibs step scans every file under
# Contents/Frameworks for Swift runtime dependencies, and warns once per empty file
# in PythonXPCService.framework/site-python ("Failed to parse executable"). Bazel has
# already built the bundle, and the Swift runtime ships with macOS 14, so the step has
# nothing to copy.

# The UI test runner (GarageAppUITests-Runner.app): Xcode signs it from its sandboxed XCTRunner
# template plus the test target's CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS, which macos_ui_test has no attribute
# for. The store tests' data folders live in the App Group container, the one folder the sandboxed
# store app, its XPC services and the runner all reach, so the runner needs the App Group, signed
# by the team that owns it (an ad hoc signature leaves it out of the group, and setup fails with
# Cocoa error 513). Only this target's build settings change.
#
# Opt-in (GARAGE_UITEST_TEAM_SIGNING=1) until it works: signed this way, the runner hung at launch on
# the M4 ("The test runner hung before establishing connection"), which stops every UI test, not just
# the store ones. The default keeps Xcode's ad hoc runner, under which the other UI tests pass.
