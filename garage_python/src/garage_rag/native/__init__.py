"""Native libraries the app's framework loads into every Python process.

``PythonXPCService.framework`` links libpq and libtesseract with load commands, so
dyld maps them when a Garage service or launcher starts, before the App Sandbox
applies (a sandboxed process may not open them by path later). Python code finds
them here, among the images already loaded into the process, and hands that path
to ctypes, which then gets the loaded copy rather than opening another file.
