"""The ingest pipeline.

Idempotency contract, per document, each in its own transaction so a crash
leaves earlier documents committed and the current one untouched:

1. **stat only.** If a row exists whose ``mtime`` and ``byte_size`` match and
   whose state is OK, skip -- without opening or parsing the file. A cloud
   placeholder whose row still holds content is judged by ``mtime`` alone when
   the stub reports no size, and is skipped without being materialized: it was
   indexed before the sync client evicted it, and nothing has changed since.
   A file remembered in ``ingest_outcomes`` as holding no text, or as failing
   extraction, is skipped the same way while its extractor's version is the one
   that gave up on it.
2. **raw hash.** If the stat changed but ``source_sha256`` did not (a touch, a
   copy that kept the bytes), refresh the stat fields and skip extraction.
3. **extract**, then hash the extracted text. A file with no text makes no
   document: any older row for it is dropped, it is counted as rejected, and its
   stat and hash are remembered, as they are for a failed extraction.
4. If ``content_sha256`` is unchanged *and* the chunker signature is unchanged,
   the chunks are still valid: refresh the stat fields, done. (Embeddings are
   not touched here; ``garage backfill`` fills in missing model vectors.)
5. Otherwise replace: upsert the document, delete its chunks (which cascades
   into every per-model embedding table), re-chunk, insert.

The two hashes are not redundant. ``source_sha256`` is over raw bytes and is
refreshed whenever a file is opened. ``content_sha256`` is over extracted text
and drives step 4, so upgrading an extractor correctly rebuilds chunks even
though the file on disk never changed.

Every candidate the walk yields -- indexed, skipped, failed, or placeholder --
is recorded in ``ingest_seen`` for its run, because reconciliation treats any
document absent from the latest completed run's observations as deleted.
