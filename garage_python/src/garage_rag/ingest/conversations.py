"""Ingesting a Messages database: one document per conversation, one chunk per message.

A ``sqlite`` source is not walked file by file. Every Messages ``chat.db`` under
its root is read with :mod:`garage_rag.extract.messages`, and each conversation
is stored like any other document through the same
:class:`~garage_rag.ingest.gateway.IngestStorageGateway`, so the in-process
pipeline and the ingest XPC worker behave alike.

The document's text is a header naming the thread and its members, then the
whole thread, one message per paragraph::

    Climbing crew
    Participants: +15551234567, friend@example.com
    Service: iMessage

    [2026-09-24 18:02 UTC] Me: running late

    [2026-09-24 18:03 UTC] +15551234567: no worries

Each message is its own chunk, spanning exactly its paragraph, so a search hit
is one message with its sender and time rather than a window that starts
mid-thread. A message longer than the configured chunk size is split into
several chunks, never merged with its neighbours. The header is part of the
content hash, so a renamed group or a new member rebuilds the document. Times
are UTC so the text does not change with the machine's time zone.

Conversations are always ``communication``, which keeps them on this machine
(see ``docs/privacy.md``). The per-document chunk cap does not apply: it guards
against a runaway file, and cutting a thread short would silently drop its
newest messages. The machine-output gate does not apply either, since every
line of a thread starts with a timestamp by construction.
