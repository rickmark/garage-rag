"""Chunking, specialized per content kind.

The strategies differ because the failure modes differ:

* **Markdown** -- split on headers first so a chunk never straddles two
  sections, then split oversized sections by size. Each chunk keeps its heading
  breadcrumb, which is often the only thing identifying what the text is about.
* **Code** -- language-aware splitting keeps functions and classes intact.
* **Prose / PDF** -- plain recursive splitting on paragraph boundaries.
* **Tabular** -- split on sheet headings, never mid-row.
* **Conversation** -- handled by :mod:`garage_rag.extract.messages`, which
  windows messages before they ever reach here.

The splitters themselves live in :mod:`garage_rag.ingest.splitters`, a small
dependency-free port of the langchain-text-splitters behaviour this module was
first written against; ``tests/test_chunking_golden.py`` pins the output to it.
