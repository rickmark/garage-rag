#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Creates (or re-imports) the self-signed code-signing identity used for local
# builds, so that locally built binaries have a *stable* code identity.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# An ad-hoc signature ("codesign -s -") has no certificate, so the designated
# requirement macOS derives for the binary is
#
#     identifier "com.example.app" and cdhash H"<hash of this exact build>"
#
# Keychain ACLs are stored as designated requirements, so every rebuild — every
# recompile, every new Bazel output — is a different application as far as the
# Keychain is concerned, and the items the app created (the Postgres superuser
# password, the LM Studio token) no longer belong to it. That is the "GarageApp
# wants to access key ..." dialog on every single build.
#
# Signing with a certificate instead anchors the requirement to the certificate:
#
#     identifier "com.example.app" and certificate root = H"<hash of the cert>"
#
# ("root" rather than "leaf" because the certificate is self-signed, so it is
# both.) The cdhash changes on every build; the certificate's hash does not, so
# the Keychain ACL keeps matching until the certificate itself is replaced.
#
# The certificate is self-signed and trusted only in this user's trust settings.
# It is good for exactly one thing — a stable local identity — and is not usable
# for distribution: no Apple-issued chain means no notarization, no Team ID that
# library validation accepts, and no Gatekeeper pass on anyone else's machine.
#
# Sharing one identity across machines
# ------------------------------------
# The requirement embeds the certificate's hash, so two machines that each
# generate their own certificate produce two different identities and neither
# can open the other's Keychain items. To make builds on a second machine count
# as the same application, move the identity rather than making a new one:
#
#     ./local_identity.sh export ~/garage-signing.p12   # on the first machine
#     ./local_identity.sh ensure --import ~/garage-signing.p12   # on the second
#

    cat <<USAGE
Usage: local_identity [ensure|show|export <path>|remove] [options]

Commands:
  ensure            Create the identity if it is not already usable (default).
  show              Print the current identity and its designated requirement.
  export <path>     Write the identity to a .p12 for use on another machine.
  remove            Delete the certificate, its key, and its trust setting.

Options:
  --identity NAME   Common name of the certificate (default: $IDENTITY)
  --keychain PATH   Keychain to hold the identity (default: the login keychain)
  --import PATH     Import this .p12 instead of generating a new certificate
  --days N          Validity of a newly generated certificate (default: $DAYS)
  --force           Replace an existing identity of the same name

Build with it by adding this line to user.bazelrc:

    build --config=local_signed

The app's existing Keychain items were created under its old ad-hoc identity, so
each one prompts once more after the switch: the item's ACL still names the old
cdhash, and "Always Allow" is what adds this certificate to it. From then on the
ACL survives rebuilds.
