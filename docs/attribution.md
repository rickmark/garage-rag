# Attribution

How the pipeline decides who wrote something and how much to trust it. Every
decision records its `evidence`, so a wrong answer is traceable to the rule
responsible.

## Precedence

Signals are tried in order; the first that produces an answer wins.

### 1. Git history — authoritative

For a tracked file, `attribute/git.py` supplies the contributors and their commit
counts. The decision that matters:

- **The owner has commits on this file** → `authored`
- **No commits by the owner** → `reference`

That single test separates your own repository from a clone of someone else's,
which no other signal can do. It works per *file*, so a fork where you changed
three files attributes those three to you and the rest to upstream.

Real output from this corpus:

```
reference  agave         owner=anza-xyz     top=Brooks           git-log:no-self-commits
reference  chainlink     owner=smartcontr…  top=Jordan Krage     git-log:no-self-commits
reference  bitchat       owner=rickmark     top=Vignesh Skanda   git-log:no-self-commits
authored   demuxusb      README.md                               git-log:self-commits:4/4
authored   integrity-coin README.md                              git-log:self-commits:4/4
```

Note `bitchat`: the remote is under your account, but you never touched that
README, so it is `reference`. Ownership of the *repository* is not authorship of
the *file*.

> **Performance.** `git log --follow` per file across ~18k tracked documents would
> mean 18k git invocations. Instead one `git log --name-only --no-renames` pass
> per repository builds a path→authors map in memory. Measured: 60 repositories,
> 277,796 tracked paths, **29 seconds** total.
>
> The tradeoff is `--no-renames`. Following renames requires per-file history; a
> renamed file is attributed from commits touching its current path, which in
> practice still identifies the right person.

### 2. Embedded document metadata

PDF `/Author`, Office core properties, Markdown frontmatter `author:`.

Reliable when present, absent most of the time — no Markdown file in this corpus
carries an `author:` key, so frontmatter is a bonus path, not a dependency.

Metadata is filtered through `looks_like_tool_name()`, because software writes
its own name into these fields. Without the filter, `python-pptx`'s default
template attributes every deck to the library's author ("Steve Canny") and
`openpyxl` names itself on every spreadsheet. Tool names are kept in `meta` for
provenance but never become authors.

A third party's name in the metadata implies `reference`; the owner's implies
`authored`. A reference-shaped *path* still overrides an authored guess — "in
`Reference/` but carries my name" is usually a paper you collected.

### 3. Path convention

`attribute/pathrules.py`, first match wins. Data, not logic — adapting to a
different layout means editing the table.

| Pattern | Trust |
|---|---|
| `Reference/*` | `reference` |
| `Documents/Paper/Reference/*` | `reference` |
| `**/{Documentation,Datasheets,Manuals,Books,Papers,Specs,RFCs}/*` | `reference` |
| `Personal/*`, `Projects/*`, `Notes/*` | `authored` |
| `Documents/{Research,Paper}/*` | `authored` |
| any component named `reference`/`papers`/`manuals`/… | `reference` |
| anything else | source default |

Vendored trees (`node_modules`, `vendor`, `third_party`, `Pods`,
`site-packages`, …) are `reference` **wherever they appear**, checked before the
path table.

### 4. Source default

Whatever `garage add-source --trust` recorded.

## Identity resolution

An author owns many identities. Resolution is lookup-by-identity, create-on-miss,
so one person arriving first as a git email and later as a PDF byline collapses
onto a single row rather than duplicating.

Configure your own identities so the authored/reference split works:

```bash
GARAGE_SELF_NAME=Your Name
GARAGE_SELF_IDENTITIES=["git_email:you@example.com","email:you@example.com","git_name:Your Name"]
```

Add every address you have committed under. An identity you omit reads as
somebody else, and your own work is filed as `reference`.

## Communications

Roles rather than a single author:

- Outbound → you are `sender`, the handles are `recipient`
- Inbound → the handle is `sender`, you are `recipient`
- Mail `Cc:` → `cc`

Trust is `authored` for what you sent, `received` for what you did not.

## Corpus class

Independent of trust, decided by content shape with the source default as
fallback (`ingest/classify.py`):

- Code extensions → `code`
- Documentation names (`README`, `LICENSE`, `SECURITY`, `CHANGELOG`…) → `document`,
  **but only when the extension is not itself a code extension**. Otherwise
  `security.rb` and `license.py` would be misfiled as prose — a bug this code had
  and now has a regression test for.
- Conversations, or a source that pins the class → `communication`

Structured config (`.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml`, `.ini`, `.csv`) counts as **code**.
As documents it was 63% of this corpus — 461k of 726k chunks of CI workflows and
dependency manifests — and pure retrieval noise. It is still indexable with
`--include-code`, filed as `code`.

## Inspecting decisions

```bash
garage extract <file>          # shows author hints and extracted metadata
garage search "..." --author "Name"
garage search "..." --trust authored     # only your own writing
garage search "..." --trust reference    # only QA'ed external material
```

The `evidence` column on `document_authors` records exactly which rule fired:

```sql
SELECT a.display_name, da.role, da.confidence, da.evidence
FROM document_authors da JOIN authors a ON a.id = da.author_id
WHERE da.document_id = 123;
```
